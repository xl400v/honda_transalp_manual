# Braking

1.	For normal braking, gradually apply both the front and rear brakes while downshifting to suit your road speed.
2.	For maximum deceleration, close the throttle and apply the front and rear brakes firmly. Pull in the clutch lever before coming to a complete stop to prevent stalling the engine.

**Warning**  
Independent use of only the front or rear brake reduces stopping performance. Extreme braking may cause either wheel to lock, reducing control of the motorcycle.
When possible, reduce speed or brake before entering a turn; closing the throttle or braking in mid-turn may cause wheel slip. Wheel slip will reduce control of the motorcycle.
When riding in wet or rainy condi¬tions, or on loose surfaces, the ability to maneuver and stop will be reduced. All of your actions should be smooth under these conditions. Rapid accel¬eration, braking or turning may cause loss of control. For your safety, exer¬cise extreme caution when braking, accelerating or turning.
When descending a long, steep grade, use engine compression braking by downshifting, with intermittent use of both brakes. Continuous brake application can overheat the brakes and reduce their effectiveness.
Riding with your foot resting on the brake pedal or your hands on the brake lever may actuate the brakelight, giving a false indication to other drivers. It may also overheat the brake, reducing effectiveness.
