# Running-In

During the first 1,000 km \(600 miles\), do not operate the motorcycle at more than 80% of the maximum speed in any gear. Avoid full throttle operation, and do not operate for a long time at one speed.
During initial running-in newly machined surfaces will be in contact with each other and these surfaces will wear in quickly. Running-in maintenance at 1,000 km \(600 miles\) is designed to compensate for this initial minor wear. Timely performance of the running-in maintenance will ensure optimum service life and performance from the engine.
