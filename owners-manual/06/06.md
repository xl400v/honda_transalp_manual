# Anti-Theft Tips

1.	Always lock the steering and never leave the key in the ignition switch. This sounds simple but people do forget.
2.	Be sure the registration information for your motorcycle is accurate and current.
3.	Park your motorcycle in a locked garage whenever possible.
4.	Use an additional anti-theft device of good quality.
5.	Put your name, address, and phone number in this Owner's Manual and keep it on your motorcycles at all times.
Many times stolen motorcycles are identified by information in the Owner's Manuals that are still with them.
