# Starting the Engine

This motorcycle is equipped with a side stand ignition cut-off system. The engine cannot be started if the side stand is down, _unless the transmission is in neutral_. If the side stand is up, the engine can be started in neutral or in gear with the clutch lever pulled in. After starting with the side stand down, the engine will shut off if the transmission is put in gear before raising the side stand.
