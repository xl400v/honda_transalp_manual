# Parking

1.	After stopping the motorcycle, shift the transmission into neutral, turn the fuel cock OFF, turn the handlebar fully to the left, turn the ignition switch OFF and remove the key.
2.	Use the side stand to support the motorcycle while parked.
3.	Lock the steering to help prevent theft [\[see page\]](https://xl400v.gitbook.io/honda-transalp/owners-manual/05/02).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution**
Park the motorcycle on firm, level ground to prevent it from falling over.
If you must park on a slight incline, aim the front of the motorcycle uphill to reduce the possibility of rolling off the side stand or overturning.

**Note** <**AR Type only**>
When stopping for a short time near traffic at night, the ignition switch may be turned to P and the key removed. This will turn on the taillight to make the motorcycle more visible to traffic. The battery will discharge if the ignition switch is left at P for too long a time.
