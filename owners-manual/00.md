# Welcome

The motorcycle presents you a challenge to master the machine, a challenge to adventure. You ride through the wind, linked to the road by a vehicle that responds to your commands as no other does. Unlike an automobile, there is no metal cage around you. Like an airplane, a pre-ride inspection and regular maintenance are essential to your safety. Your reward is freedom.

To meet the challenges safely, and to enjoy the adventure fully, you should become thoroughly familiar with this owner's manual BEFORE YOU RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE.

When service is required, remember that your Honda dealer knows your motorcycle best. If you have the required mechanical "know-how" and tools, your dealer can supply you with an official Honda Service Manual to help you perform many maintenance and repair tasks.

> ## Pleasant riding, and thank you for choosing a Honda!
