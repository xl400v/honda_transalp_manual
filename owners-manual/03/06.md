# Tyres

Proper air pressure will provide maximum stability, riding comfort and tyre life. Check tyre pressure frequently and adjust if neccessary.

**Note**  
Tyre pressure should be checked before you ride while the tyres are "cold".

On/off-road tyres are standard on this model. Select the right replacement tyres in accordance with the following specifications. Check the tyres for cuts, embedded nails, or other sharp objects. See your authorized Honda dealer for replacement of damaged tyres or punctured inner tubes.

**Warning**  
&bull;&nbsp;Do not attempt to patch a damaged tyre or inner tube. Wheel balance and tyre reliability may be impaired.  
&bull;&nbsp;Improper tyre inflation will cause abnormal tread wear and create a safety hazard. Underinflation may result in the tyre slipping on, or coming off of the rim causing tyre deflation that may result in a loss of vehicle control.  
&bull;&nbsp;Operation with excessively worn tyres is hazardous and will adversely affect traction and handling.  
&bull;&nbsp;The use of tyres other than those listed on the tyre information label may adversely affect handling.  
&bull;&nbsp;Maintenance of spoke tension and wheel trueness are critical to safe motorcycle operation. During the first 1,000&nbsp;km \(600&nbsp;miles\) spokes will loosen more rapidly due to initial seating of parts. Excessively loose spokes may result in high speed instability and possible loss of control.

Replace tyres before tread depth at the center of the tyre reaches the following limit:

* Minimum tread depth Front: 1.5&nbsp;mm \(0.06&nbsp;in\)
* Minimum tread depth Rear: 2.0&nbsp;mm \(0.08&nbsp;in\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note** &lt;For Germany&gt;  
German law prohibits use of tyres whose tread depth is less than 1.6&nbsp;mm.
