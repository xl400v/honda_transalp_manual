## Welcome

The motorcycle presrnts you a challenge to master the machine, a challenge to adventure. You ride through the wind, linked to the road by a vehicle that responds to your commands as noother does. Unlike an automobile, there is no metal cage around you. Like an airlane, a pre-ride inspection and regular maintenance are essential to your safety. Your reward is freedom.​

To meet the challenges safely, and to enjoy the adventure fully, you should become thoroughly familiar with this owner's manual BEFORE YOU RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE.​

When service is required, remember that your Honda dealer knows your motorcycle best. If you have the required mechanical "know-how" and tools, your dealer can supply you with an official Honda Service Manual to help you perform many miantenance and repair tasks.​

> #### Pleasant riding, and thank you for choosing a Honda!​
