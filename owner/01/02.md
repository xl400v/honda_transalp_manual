# Protective Apparel

1. Most motorcycle accident fatalities are due to head injuries: ALWAYS wear a helmet. You should also wear a face shield or goggles as well as boots, gloves and protective clothing. A passenger needs the same protection.

2. The exhaust system becomes hot during operation, and it remains hot for a while after stopping the engine. Be careful not to touch the exhaust system while it is hot. Wear clothing that fully covers your legs.

3. Do not wear loose clothing which could catch on the control levels, footpegs, drive chain or wheels.
