# Safe Riding Rules

1. Always make a pre-ride inspection \(page 37\) before you start the engine. You may prevent an accident or equipment damage.

2. Many accidents involve inexperienced riders. Most countries require a special motorcycle riding test or license. Make sure you are qualified before you ride. NEVER lend your motorcycle to an inexperienced rider.

3. Many automobile/motorcycle accidents happen because the automobile driver does not "see" the motorcyclist.  
Make yourself conspicuous to help avoid the accident that wasn't your fault:

* Wear bright or reflective clothing.
* Don't ride in another motorist's "blind spot."​

4. Obey all national and local laws and regulations.​

* Excessive speed in a factor in many accidents. Obey the speed limits, and NEVER travel faster then conditions warrant.
* Signal before you make a turn or lane change. Your size and maneuverability can surprise other motorists.

5. Don't let other motorists surprise you. Use extra caution at intersections, parking lot entrances and exits, and driveways.

6. Keep both hands on the handlebars and both feet on the footpegs while riding. A passenger should hold on to the motorcycle or the operator with both hands and keep both feet on the passenger footpegs.
